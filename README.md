x402BTC Lightning Network










<img src="logo.png">

The x402BTC Lightning Network Daemon (x402lnd) is a complete implementation of a
Lightning Network
 node for the x402BTC ecosystem.
x402lnd includes several pluggable back-end chain services such as
btcd
 (full node),
bitcoind
, and
neutrino
 (experimental light client).

The project leverages the btcsuite
 Bitcoin libraries and exports
a large set of reusable Lightning Network-related modules.

x402lnd currently supports:

Creating payment channels

Closing channels

Full channel state management (including exception handling)

Maintaining an authenticated and validated channel graph

Network path finding and passive payment forwarding

Sending outgoing onion-encrypted payments

Updating advertised fee schedules

Automatic channel management (autopilot
)

Lightning Network Specification Compliance

x402lnd fully conforms to the Lightning Network specification (BOLTs)
.
BOLT stands for Basis of Lightning Technology. The specifications are a collaborative effort
among multiple implementations, including x402lnd.

Current BOLT compliance:

 BOLT 1: Base Protocol

 BOLT 2: Peer Protocol for Channel Management

 BOLT 3: Bitcoin Transaction and Script Formats

 BOLT 4: Onion Routing Protocol

 BOLT 5: Recommendations for On-chain Transaction Handling

 BOLT 7: P2P Node and Channel Discovery

 BOLT 8: Encrypted and Authenticated Transport

 BOLT 9: Assigned Feature Flags

 BOLT 10: DNS Bootstrap and Assisted Node Location

 BOLT 11: Invoice Protocol for Lightning Payments
