// created as the widely used schemes in the space lack two critical traits: a
// version byte, and a birthday timestamp. The version allows us to modify the
// details of the scheme in the future, and the birthday gives wallets a limit
// of how far back in the chain they'll need to start scanning. We also add an
// external version to the enciphering plaintext seed. With this addition,
// seeds are able to be "upgraded" (to diff params, or entirely diff crypt),
// while maintaining the semantics of the plaintext seed.
//
// The core of the scheme is the usage of aez to carefully control the size of
// the final encrypted seed. With the current parameters, this scheme can be
// encoded using a 24 word mnemonic. We use 4 bytes of ciphertext expansion
// when enciphering the raw seed, giving us the equivalent of 40-bit MAC (as we
// check for a particular seed version). Using the external 4 byte checksum,
// we're able to ensure that the user input the correct set of words.  Finally,
// the password in the scheme is optional. If not specified, "aezeed" will be

// users can encrypt the raw "plaintext" seed under distinct passwords to
