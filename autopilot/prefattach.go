// channel establishment, the heuristic will attempt to favor connecting to
// nodes which already have a set amount of links, selected by sampling from a
// power law distribution. The attachment ins non-linear in that it favors
// nodes with a higher in-degree but less so that regular linear preferential
// attachment. As a result, this creates smaller and less clusters than regular
// linear preferential attachment.
