// BeatConsumer defines a supplementary component that should be used by
// subsystems which implement the `Consumer` interface. It partially implements
// the `Consumer` interface by providing the method `ProcessBlock` such that
// subsystems don't need to re-implement it.
//
// While inheritance is not commonly used in Go, subsystems embedding this
// struct cannot pass the interface check for `Consumer` because the `Name`
// method is not implemented, which gives us a "mortise and tenon" structure.
// In addition to reducing code duplication, this design allows `ProcessBlock`
// to work on the concrete type `Beat` to access its internal states.
