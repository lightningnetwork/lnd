The chainntnfs package implements a set of interfaces which allow callers to
receive notifications in response to specific on-chain events. The set of
notifications available include: 

  * Notifications for each new block connected to the current best chain.
  * Notifications once a `txid` has reached a specified number of
    confirmations.
  * Notifications once a target outpoint (`txid:index`) has been spent.

These notifications are used within `lnd` in order to properly handle the
workflows for: channel funding, cooperative channel closures, forced channel
closures, channel contract breaches, sweeping time-locked outputs, and finally
pruning the channel graph. 

This package is intentionally general enough to be applicable outside the
specific use cases within `lnd` outlined above. The current sole concrete
implementation of the `ChainNotifier` interface depends on `btcd`.
