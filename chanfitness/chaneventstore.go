// Package chanfitness monitors the behaviour of channels to provide insight
// into the health and performance of a channel. This is achieved by maintaining
// an event store which tracks events for each channel.
//
// Lifespan: the period that the channel has been known to the scoring system.
// Note that lifespan may not equal the channel's full lifetime because data is
// not currently persisted.
//
// Uptime: the total time within a given period that the channel's remote peer
// has been online.
