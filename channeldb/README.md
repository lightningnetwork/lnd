The channeldb implements the persistent storage engine for `lnd` and
generically a data storage layer for the required state within the Lightning
Network. The backing storage engine is
[boltdb](https://github.com/coreos/bbolt), an embedded pure-go key-value store
based off of LMDB.

The package implements an object-oriented storage model with queries and
mutations flowing through a particular object instance rather than the database
itself. The storage implemented by the objects includes: open channels, past
commitment revocation states, the channel graph which includes authenticated
node and channel announcements, outgoing payments, and invoices
