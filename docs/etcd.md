# Experimental etcd support in LND

With the recent introduction of the `kvdb` interface LND can support multiple
database backends allowing experimentation with the storage model as well as
improving robustness through eg. replicating essential data.

Building on `kvdb` in v0.11.0 we're adding experimental [etcd](https://etcd.io)
support to LND. As this is an unstable feature heavily in development, it still
has *many* rough edges for the time being. It is therefore highly recommended to
not use LND on `etcd` in any kind of production environment especially not
on bitcoin mainnet.

## Building LND with etcd support

To create a dev build of LND with etcd support use the following command:

```shell
⛰  make tags="kvdb_etcd"
```

The important tag is the `kvdb_etcd`, without which the binary is built without
the etcd driver.

For development it is advised to set the `GOFLAGS` environment variable to 
`"-tags=test"` otherwise `gopls` won't work on code in `channeldb/kvdb/etcd`
directory.

## Running a local etcd instance for testing

To start your local etcd instance for testing run:

```shell
⛰  ./etcd \
    --auto-tls \
    --advertise-client-urls=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
    --listen-client-urls=https://0.0.0.0:2379 \
    --max-txn-ops=16384 \
    --max-request-bytes=104857600
```

The large `max-txn-ops` and `max-request-bytes` values are currently required in
case of running LND with the full graph in etcd. These parameters have been
tested to work with testnet LND.

## Configuring LND to run on etcd

To run LND with etcd, additional configuration is needed, specified either
through command line flags or in `lnd.conf`.

Sample command line:

```shell
⛰  ./lnd-debug \
    --db.backend=etcd \
    --db.etcd.host=127.0.0.1:2379 \
    --db.etcd.certfile=/home/user/etcd/bin/default.etcd/fixtures/client/cert.pem \
    --db.etcd.keyfile=/home/user/etcd/bin/default.etcd/fixtures/client/key.pem \
    --db.etcd.insecure_skip_verify
```

Sample `lnd.conf` (with other setting omitted):

```text
[db]
db.backend=etcd
db.etcd.host=127.0.0.1:2379
db.etcd.cerfile=/home/user/etcd/bin/default.etcd/fixtures/client/cert.pem
db.etcd.keyfile=/home/user/etcd/bin/default.etcd/fixtures/client/key.pem
db.etcd.insecure_skip_verify=true
```

Optionally users can specify `db.etcd.user` and `db.etcd.pass` for db user
authentication. If the database is shared, it is possible to separate our data
from other users by setting `db.etcd.namespace` to an (already existing) etcd
namespace. In order to test without TLS, users are able to set `db.etcd.disabletls`
flag to `true`.

## Migrating existing channel.db to etcd

This is currently not supported.

## Disclaimer

As mentioned before this is an experimental feature, and with that your data
may be lost. Use at your own risk!
