# Release Notes

## Peer to Peer Behavior

`lnd` will now [properly prioritize sending out gossip updates generated
locally to all connected
peers](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7239), regardless of their
current gossip sync query status.

There's also a [bug fix](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7186)
that might lead to channel updates being missed, causing channel graph being
incomplete. Aside from that, a potential announcement messages being sent out
of order is also [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7264).

## BOLT Specs

* Warning messages from peers are now recognized and
  [logged](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6546) by lnd.

* Decrypt onion failure messages with a [length greater than 256
  bytes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6913). This moves LND
  closer to being spec compliant.

* Channel updates without the maxHTLC message flag set are recognized as invalid
  and are [not relayed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7415).

## RPC

* The `RegisterConfirmationsNtfn` call of the `chainnotifier` RPC sub-server 
 [now optionally supports returning the entire block that confirmed the 
 transaction](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6730).

* [Add `macaroon_root_key` field to
  `InitWalletRequest`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6457) to
  allow specifying a root key for macaroons during wallet init rather than
  having lnd randomly generate one for you.

* [A new `SignedInputs`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6771)
  field is added to `SignPsbtResponse` that returns the indices of inputs
  that were signed by our wallet. Prior to this change `SignPsbt` didn't
  indicate whether the Psbt held any inputs for our wallet to sign.

* [Add list addresses RPC](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6596).

* Add [TrackPayments](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6335)
  method to the RPC to allow subscribing to updates from any inflight payment.
  Similar to TrackPaymentV2, but for any inflight payment.

* [Catch and throw an error](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6945)
  during `openchannel` if the local funding amount given is zero.

* [Extend](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6831) the HTLC
  interceptor server implementation with watchdog functionality to cancel back
  HTLCs for which an interceptor client does not provide a resolution in time.
  If an HTLC expires, the counterparty will claim it back on-chain and the
  receiver will lose it. Therefore the receiver can just as well fail off-chain
  a few blocks before so that the channel is saved.

* [Make remote channel reserve amount configurable for 
  `openchannel`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6956)

* [`ForwardingHistory` ](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7001) now
  enriches each forwarding event with inbound and outbound peer alias names if
  the new flag `PeerAliasLookup` in `ForwardingHistoryRequest` is set to true.
  [`lncli fwdinghistory` ](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7083)
  enables this feature by default but adds a new flag `skip_peer_alias_lookup`
  to skip the lookup.

* [Add the possibility to define a change address type
  for FundPsbt RPC call](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7348).
  If no address type is specified for default/imported accounts, P2WKH will be
  used. No custom address type should be provided for custom accounts as we will
  always use the coin selection key scope to generate the change address. This
  possibility is available in lncli as well.

* The graph lookups method `DescribeGraph`, `GetNodeInfo` and `GetChanInfo` now
  [expose tlv data](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7085) that is
  broadcast over the gossip network.

* [Add new HTLC notifier event and lookup
  RPC](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6517) for the final
  settlement of incoming HTLCs. This allows applications to wait for the HTLC to
  actually disappear from all valid commitment transactions, rather than assume
  that it will. With the new extensions, situations can be avoided where the
  application considers an HTLC settled, but in reality the HTLC has timed out.

  Final resolution data will only be available for htlcs that are resolved
  after upgrading lnd. Once resolved, it's final status can be retrieved via
  [`LookupHtlcResolution`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7467).

  This feature is [opt-in](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7341)
  via a config flag. The status of the flag is
  [exposed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7402) at run-time
  through GetInfo.

* Zero-amount private invoices [now provide hop
  hints](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7082), up to `maxHopHints`
  (20 currently).

* [Add `creation_date_start` and `creation_date_end` filter fields to
  `ListInvoiceRequest` and
  `ListPaymentsRequest`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7159).

* [Add chainkit RPC endpoints](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7197):
  GetBlock, GetBestBlock, GetBlockHash. These endpoints provide access to chain
  block data.

* [`QueryProbabiltiy` is deprecated. Internal mission control state can be 
  obtained via `QueryMissionControl`.](
  https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6857)

* [Ensure that closing addresses match the node network for `OpenChannel` 
  requests](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7272)

* The `SendCustomMessage` and `SubscribeCustomMessage` APIs can now be used to
  send and receive custom messages below the custom range if lnd is built with
  the `dev` tag, and configured to [opt into overriding a specific message 
  type](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7153)

* [Sign/Verify messages and signatures for single
  addresses](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7231).

* [A bug has been fixed within the `SignOutputRaw` call for taproot
  signatures](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7332).  The
  `SignOutputRaw` call will now properly work for taproot signatures with a
  non-default sighash.

* [The experimental MuSig2 RPC in the `signrpc` package was upgraded to the BIP
  draft version `v1.0.0rc2`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7171).
  To remain backward compatible with applications that have on-chain funds on
  keys that were created with the previous version of the MuSig2 BIP draft
  `v0.4.0` (such as Pool accounts) a version flag was added to the
  `MuSig2CombineKeys` and `MuSig2CreateSession` RPC calls. That version flag is
  mandatory, which means software using MuSig2 (such as Pool or Loop) must
  update in order to use the new versioned RPC and upgrade any on-chain outputs
  to the new version.

* [A bug has been fixed which could cause `lnd` to crash when parsing a
  malformed HTLC intercept message](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7392).

* [A bug](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7408) in the 
  `updatenodeannouncement` peers cli which did not allow setting/
   unsetting of feature bits also has been fixed. 

* [Enrich the `Channel` message with a peers' alias in order to retrieve it
  in `ListChannels`.](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7322) This
  behavior is opt-in for users of the rpc interface through a new parameter in
  `ListChannelsRequest` called `PeerAliasLookup`. For users of lncli this
  parameter is enabled by default but can be disabled with a new flag
  `--skip_peer_alias_lookup`.

* Assign potential peer alias lookup errors in the [`ListChannels` and
  `ForwardingHistory`rpcs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7471) to
  the rpc response.

## Wallet

* [Allows Taproot public keys and tap scripts to be imported as watch-only
  addresses into the internal
  wallet](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6775). NOTE that funding
  PSBTs from imported tap scripts is not currently possible.

* [The wallet birthday is now used properly when creating a watch-only wallet
  to avoid scanning the whole
  chain](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7056).

* [The PSBT output information for change outputs is now properly added when
  funding a PSBT through
  `FundPsbt`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7209).

* [Fix the issue of ghost UTXOs not being detected as spent if they were created
  with an external tool](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7243).

* [Add log message for edge
  case](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7115).

* [A remote signer issue was fixed that caused opening channels to fail when
  multiple mixed-type inputs were used for the funding
  transaction](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7386).

## Build

* [The project has updated to Go
1.19](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6795)! Go 1.18 is now the
minimum version needed to build the project.

* [The minimum recommended version of the Go 1.19.x series is 1.19.2 because
1.19.1 contained a bug that affected lnd and resulted in a
crash](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7019).

* [Use Go's `runtime/debug` package to get information about the build](
https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6963/)

* [A wire parsing bug has been fixed that would cause lnd to be unable _decode_
certain large transactions](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7100).

## Invoices

* Define a new [InvoiceDB](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7215) 
interface to be used in all the packages that need to interact with invoice 
data.

  `lnd` now parses Tor control port messages correctly.

* [Add option to encrypt Tor private 
  key](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6500), and [update the Tor
  module](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6526) to pave the way for
  this functionality.

  library](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7127). [Updated build
  and documentation to reflect
  this](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7142).

* [Added missing wire tests for Warning
  message](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7143).

* [The description for the `--gossip.pinned-syncers` flag was fixed to explain
  that multiple peers can be specified by using the flag multiple times instead
  of using a comma separated list of
  values](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7207).

* [Updated several tlv stream-decoding callsites to use tlv/v1.1.0 P2P variants
  for untrusted input.](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7227)

* [Prevent nil pointer dereference during funding manager 
  test](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7268)
  
* Fixed a [failure message parsing bug](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7262)
  that caused additional failure message data to be interpreted as being part of
  a channel update.

* [Fix addinvoice expiry flag comment](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7306).

* [Code style cleanup](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7308) in the

  scope](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7330) inside `ChannelRouter`.

* [Add Custom Message to the fuzz testsuite
in the lnwire package](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7303)

* [Remove non-existent Cleanup calls from etcd test code in the `kvdb` 
  package](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7352)

  from the graph.](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7292)

* [Add a flag](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6527) to allow for
  the option to encrypt the tls key.

* [Remove unused args](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7387)
  from `cert.GenCertPair`.

* [Fixup GenCertPair use](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7388)
  after updating to cert/v1.2.1.

## `lncli`

* [Add an `insecure` flag to skip tls auth as well as a `metadata` string slice
  flag](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6818) that allows the
  caller to specify key-value string pairs that should be appended to the
  outgoing context.

* [Fix](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6858) command line argument
  parsing for `lncli sendpayment`.

* [Fix](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6875) mapslice cap out of 
  range error that occurs if the number of profiles is zero.

* [A new config option, `batchwindowduration` has been added to
  `sweeper`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6868) to allow
  customize sweeper batch duration.

* [Add `base_fee_msat` and `fee_rate_ppm` flags to
  `openchannel`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6753) requests 
  so that the user can specify fees during channel creation time in addition
  to the default configuration.

* [Sleep for 10ms when funding locked message is not
  received](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7126) to avoid CPU
  spike.

* [A new config option, `mailboxdeliverytimeout` has been added to
  `htlcswitch`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7066).

* [Add check for `pay_req` argument in `sendpayment` and `decodepayreq`
  commands to trim "lightning:" prefix before processing the request](
  https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7150). Invoices may be prefixed
  with "lightning:" on mobile and web apps and it's likely for users to copy
  the invoice payment request together with the prefix, which throws checksum
  error when pasting it to the CLI.

* [Allow lncli to read binary PSBTs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7122)
  from a file during PSBT channel funding flow to comply with [BIP 174](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki#specification)

* [Add interface to chainkit RPC](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7197).
  This addition consists of the `chain` subcommand group: `getblock`,
  `getblockhash`, and `getbestblock`. These commands provide access to chain
  block data.

* [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7186) that might
  lead to channel updates being missed, causing channel graph being incomplete.

* During reconnection, enabling channels might be failed due to the startup of
  link is falling behind, which is now fixed by [retrying the enable
  request](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7157). 

* [Sign/Verify messages and signatures for single
  addresses](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7231).
  
* [Allow `--stateless_init` mode to be used for watch-only
  wallets](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7462).

## Code Health

* [test: use `T.TempDir` to create temporary test
  directory](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6710)

* [The `tlv` package now allows decoding records larger than 65535 bytes. The
  caller is expected to know that doing so with untrusted input is
  unsafe.](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6779)
 
* [test: replace defer cleanup with
  `t.Cleanup`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6864).

* [test: fix loop variables being accessed in
  closures](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7032).

* [Fix loop and other temporary variables being accessed in
  goroutines](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7188).

* [CI: update test coverage library
  go-acc](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7221) v0.2.6 -> v0.2.8

* Payment related code [has been
  refactored](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7174) to allow the
  usage of new payment statuses.

* [Fixed a test closure](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7337)
  issue found in `bitcoindnotify/bitcoind_test.go`.

* Add methods to easily check if an invoice [is AMP or 
  Keysend](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7334).

* [Fixed a unit test flake in the wallet
  unlocker](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7384).

* [A new generic LRU cache is used where
  applicable](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7406).

## Watchtowers

* [Create a towerID-to-sessionID index in the wtclient DB to improve the 
  speed of listing sessions for a particular tower ID](
  https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6972). This PR also ensures a 
  closer coupling of Towers and Sessions and ensures that a session cannot be
  added if the tower it is referring to does not exist.

* [Remove `AckedUpdates` & `CommittedUpdates` from the `ClientSession`
  struct](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6928) in order to
  improve the performance of fetching a `ClientSession` from the DB.

* [Allow user to update tower address without requiring a restart. Also allow
  the removal of a tower address if the current session negotiation is not
  using the address in question](
  https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7025)

* [Store AckedUpdates in a more compact
  way](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7055)

## DB

* [Add a sqlite backend 
  option](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7251) to the kvdb
  package, and add it as a [backend option to
  LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7252). Note that with this
  upgrade, support for the `dragonfly-amd64`, `netbsd-386`, `netbsd-arm64` and
  `openbsd-386` platforms has been dropped.

* [Bumped etcd dependencies to
  3.5.7](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7353) to resolve linking
  issues with outdated dependencies.

* [Re-add local and remote output amounts to the revocation 
  log](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7379) and add a new 
  `--db.no-rev-log-amt-data` flag that can be used to explicitly opt out of  
  storing this extra data. It should be noted that setting this flag is not 
  recommended unless the user is sure that they will never activate their 
  watchtower client (`--wtclient.active`) in the future. The new flag can not
  be set at all if the `--wtclient.active` flag has been set.

## Pathfinding

* [Pathfinding takes capacity of edges into account to improve success
  probability estimation.](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6857)
* [A new probability model ("bimodal") is added which models channel based
  liquidities within a probability theory framework.](
  https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6815)
* [The a priori capacity factor is made configurable and its effect is 
  limited.](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7444)

## Configuration
* Note that [this pathfinding change](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6815)
  introduces a breaking change in lnd.conf apriori parameters under the routing
  section, see sample-lnd.conf for an updated configuration. The behavior of
  `lncli setmccfg/getmccfg` is altered as well.


### Tooling and documentation

* [The `golangci-lint` tool was updated to
  `v1.50.1`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7173)

* [Tests in `htlcswitch` will now clean up the temporary resources they create](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6832).

* Updated the github actions to use `make fmt-check` in its [build
  process](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6853).

* Database related code was refactored to [allow external tools to use it more
  easily](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5561), in preparation for
  adding a data migration functionality to `lndinit`.

* [`golangci-lint` will now check new code using additional
  linters](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7064) and was
  [fine-tuned](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7289) to fit our
  code style or to [disable annoying new
  linters](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7335).

* Update github actions to [check commits against the target base 
  branch](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7103) rather than just 
  using the master branch. And [skip the commit 
  check](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7114) for all non-PR 
  events. The Golang build cache [was also optimized to speed up tests and
  builds](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7295).

* Fixed docker image version used in
  [`tools`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7254) and golangci
  issue where [it cannot fetch
  commits](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7374).

### Integration test

* The `lntest` has been
[refactored](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6759) to provide a
better testing suite for writing integration tests. A new defined structure is
implemented, please refer to
[README](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/lntemp) for more
details. Along the way, several
PRs([6776](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6776),
[6822](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6822),
[7172](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7172),
[7242](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7242),
[7245](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7245)),
[6823](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6823),
[6824](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6824),
[6825](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6825)) have been made to
refactor the itest for code health and maintenance.
