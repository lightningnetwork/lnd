# Release Notes

## BOLT Specs

* Warning messages from peers are now recognized and
  [logged](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6546) by lnd.

## RPC

* The `RegisterConfirmationsNtfn` call of the `chainnotifier` RPC sub-server 
 [now optionally supports returning the entire block that confirmed the 
 transaction](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6730).

* [Add `macaroon_root_key` field to
  `InitWalletRequest`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6457) to
  allow specifying a root key for macaroons during wallet init rather than
  having lnd randomly generate one for you.

* [A new `SignedInputs`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6771)
  field is added to `SignPsbtResponse` that returns the indices of inputs
  that were signed by our wallet. Prior to this change `SignPsbt` didn't
  indicate whether the Psbt held any inputs for our wallet to sign.

* [Add list addresses RPC](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6596).

* Add [TrackPayments](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6335)
  method to the RPC to allow subscribing to updates from any inflight payment.
  Similar to TrackPaymentV2, but for any inflight payment.

* [Catch and throw an error](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6945)
  during `openchannel` if the local funding amount given is zero.

* [Extend](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6831) the HTLC
  interceptor server implementation with watchdog functionality to cancel back
  HTLCs for which an interceptor client does not provide a resolution in time.
  If an HTLC expires, the counterparty will claim it back on-chain and the
  receiver will lose it. Therefore the receiver can just as well fail off-chain
  a few blocks before so that the channel is saved.

* [Make remote channel reserve amount configurable for 
  `openchannel`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6956)

## Wallet

* [Allows Taproot public keys and tap scripts to be imported as watch-only
  addresses into the internal
  wallet](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6775). NOTE that funding
  PSBTs from imported tap scripts is not currently possible.

## Routing

* Experimental support for [inbound routing
  fees](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6703) is added. This allows
  node operators to require senders to pay an inbound fee for forwards and
  payments. It is recommended to only use negative fees (an inbound "discount")
  initially to keep the channels open for senders that do not recognize inbound
  fees. In this release, no send support for pathfinding and route building is
  added yet. We first want to learn more about the impact that inbound fees have
  on the routing economy.

## Build

[The project has updated to Go
1.19](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6795)! Go 1.18 is now the
minimum version needed to build the project.

[The minimum recommended version of the Go 1.19.x series is 1.19.2 because
1.19.1 contained a bug that affected lnd and resulted in a
crash](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7019).

[Use Go's `runtime/debug` package to get information about the build](
https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6963/)

## Misc

* [Fixed a bug where the Switch did not reforward settles or fails for
  waiting-close channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6789)

* [Fixed a flake in the TestChannelLinkCancelFullCommitment unit
  test](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6792).

* [Fixed error typo](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6659).

* [The macaroon key store implementation was refactored to be more generally
  usable](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6509).

* [Fixed a bug where cookie authentication with Tor would fail if the cookie
  path contained spaces](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6829).
  [With the module updated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6836),
  `lnd` now parses Tor control port messages correctly.

* [Add option to encrypt Tor private 
  key](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6500), and [update the Tor
  module](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6526) to pave the way for
  this functionality.

* [Fixed potential data race on funding manager
  restart](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6929).

* [Fixed a flake in the TestBlockCacheMutexes unit
  test](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7029).

## `lncli`
* [Add an `insecure` flag to skip tls auth as well as a `metadata` string slice
  flag](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6818) that allows the
  caller to specify key-value string pairs that should be appended to the
  outgoing context.

* [Fix](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6858) command line argument
  parsing for `lncli sendpayment`.

* [Fix](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6875) mapslice cap out of 
  range error that occurs if the number of profiles is zero.

* [A new config option, `batchwindowduration` has been added to
  `sweeper`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6868) to allow
  customize sweeper batch duration.

* [Add `base_fee_msat` and `fee_rate_ppm` flags to
  `openchannel`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6753) requests 
  so that the user can specify fees during channel creation time in addition
  to the default configuration.

## Code Health

* [test: use `T.TempDir` to create temporary test
  directory](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6710)

* [The `tlv` package now allows decoding records larger than 65535 bytes. The
  caller is expected to know that doing so with untrusted input is
  unsafe.](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6779)
 
## Watchtowers

* [Create a towerID-to-sessionID index in the wtclient DB to improve the 
  speed of listing sessions for a particular tower ID](
  https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6972). This PR also ensures a 
  closer coupling of Towers and Sessions and ensures that a session cannot be
  added if the tower it is referring to does not exist.

* [Remove `AckedUpdates` & `CommittedUpdates` from the `ClientSession`
  struct](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6928) in order to
  improve the performance of fetching a `ClientSession` from the DB.

* [Create a helper function to wait for peer to come
  online](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6931).

* [test: replace defer cleanup with
  `t.Cleanup`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6864).

* [test: fix loop variables being accessed in
  closures](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7032).

### Tooling and documentation

* [The `golangci-lint` tool was updated to
  `v1.46.2`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6731)

* [Tests in `htlcswitch` will now clean up the temporary resources they create](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6832).

* Updated the github actions to use `make fmt-check` in its [build
  process](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6853).

* Database related code was refactored to [allow external tools to use it more
  easily](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5561), in preparation for
  adding a data migration functionality to `lndinit`.

### Integration test

The `lntest` has been
[refactored](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6759) to provide a
better testing suite for writing integration tests. A new defined structure is
implemented, please refer to
[README](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/lntemp) for more
details.
