# Release Notes

## Payment

* [Deprecated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7175)
  `StatusUnknown` from the payment's rpc response in its status and replaced it
  with `StatusInitiated` to explicitly report its current state.

* [The payment lifecycle inside
  router](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7391) has been
  refactored to return more verbose errors on payments.
