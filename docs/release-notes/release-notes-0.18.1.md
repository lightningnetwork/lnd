# Bug Fixes

* `closedchannels` now [successfully reports](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8800)
  settled balances even if the delivery address is set to an address that
  LND does not control.

* [SendPaymentV2](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8734) now cancels
  the background payment loop if the user cancels the stream context.

* [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8822) that caused
  LND to read the config only partially and continued with the startup.

# New Features
## Functional Enhancements
## RPC Additions

* The [SendPaymentRequest](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8734) 
  message receives a new flag `cancelable` which indicates if the payment loop 
  is cancelable. The cancellation can either occur manually by cancelling the 
  send payment stream context, or automatically at the end of the timeout period 
  if the user provided `timeout_seconds`.

* [`ExportChannelBackup`, `ExportAllChannelBackups`, and
  `SubscribeChannelBackups`][close] RPCs of LND are getting new argument:
  `bool with_close_tx_inputs`. If it is set, the RPCs return channel backups
  with the material needed to produce a force-close tx, given the private key
  is available at restore time.

## lncli Additions

* [Added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8491) the `cltv_expiry`
  argument to `addinvoice` and `addholdinvoice`, allowing users to set the
  `min_final_cltv_expiry_delta`.

* The [`lncli wallet estimatefeerate`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8730)
  command returns the fee rate estimate for on-chain transactions in sat/kw and
  sat/vb to achieve a given confirmation target.

* [`lncli exportchanbackup`][close] gets new flag `--with_close_tx_inputs`.
  If it is specified, the produced channel backup has the material needed to
  produce a force-close tx, given the private key is available at restore time.

# Improvements
## Functional Updates

* lnd gets new flag [`--backupclosetxinputs`][close]. Pass the option to enable
  inclusion of data needed for unilateral channel closure in an SCB file. This
  option increases the file size by approximately 25%. Reserve this option as
  a last resort when the peer is offline and all other avenues to retrieve funds
  from the channel have been exhausted.

## RPC Updates

* [`xImportMissionControl`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8779) 
  now accepts `0` failure amounts.

* [`ChanInfoRequest`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8813)
  adds support for channel points.

## lncli Updates

* [`importmc`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8779) now accepts
  `0` failure amounts.
 
* [`getchaninfo`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8813) now accepts
  a channel outpoint besides a channel id.

* [Fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8823) how we parse the
  `--amp` flag when sending a payment specifying the payment request.

## Code Health
## Breaking Changes
## Performance Improvements

* Mission Control Store [improved performance during DB
  flushing](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8549) stage.
