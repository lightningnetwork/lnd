# Bug Fixes
# New Features

The main channel state machine and database now allow for processing and storing
custom Taproot script leaves, [allowing the implementation of custom channel
types](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8960).

## Functional Enhancements

* A new `protocol.simple-taproot-overlay-chans` configuration item/CLI flag was
  added [to turn on custom channel
  functionality](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8960).

* Compatibility with [`bitcoind 
  v28.0`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9059) was ensured by
  updating the version the CI pipeline is running against.

## RPC Additions

* Some new experimental [RPCs for managing SCID
  aliases](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8960) were added under
  the `routerrpc` package. These methods allow manually adding and deleting SCID
  aliases locally to your node.
  > NOTE: these new RPC methods are marked as experimental
  (`XAddLocalChanAliases` & `XDeleteLocalChanAliases`) and upon calling
  them the aliases will not be communicated with the channel peer.

* The responses for the `ListChannels`, `PendingChannels` and `ChannelBalance`
  RPCs now include [a new `custom_channel_data` field that is only set for 
  custom channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8960).

* The `routerrpc.SendPaymentV2` RPC has a new field [`first_hop_custom_records`
  that allows the user to send custom p2p wire message TLV types to the first
  hop of a payment](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8960).
  That new field is also exposed in the `routerrpc.HtlcInterceptor`, so it can
  be read and interpreted by external software.

* The `routerrpc.HtlcInterceptor` now [allows some values of the HTLC to be
  modified before they're validated by the state
  machine](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8960). The fields that
  can be modified are `outgoing_amount_msat` (if transported overlaid value of
  HTLC doesn't match the actual BTC amount being transferred) and
  `outgoing_htlc_wire_custom_records` (allow adding custom TLV values to the
  p2p wire message of the forwarded HTLC).

* A new [`invoicesrpc.HtlcModifier` RPC now allows incoming HTLCs that attempt
  to satisfy an invoice to be modified before they're
  validated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8960). This allows
  custom channels to determine what the actual (overlaid) value of an HTLC is,
  even if that value doesn't match the actual BTC amount being transferred by
  the HTLC.

## lncli Additions

* [`updatechanpolicy`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8805) will
  now update the channel policy if the edge was not found in the graph
  database if the `create_missing_edge` flag is set.
