# Bug Fixes

* [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8857) to correctly 
  propagate mission control and debug level config values to the main LND config
  struct so that the GetDebugInfo response is accurate.

* [Fix a bug](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9134) that would 
  cause a nil pointer dereference during the probing of a payment request that 
  does not contain a payment address.
  
* [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9033) where we
  would not signal an error when trying to bump an non-anchor channel but
  instead report a successful cpfp registration although no fee bumping is
  possible for non-anchor channels anyways.

* [Use the required route blinding 
  feature-bit](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9143) for invoices 
  containing blinded paths.

* [Fix a bug](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9137) that prevented
  a graceful shutdown of LND during the main chain backend sync check in certain
  cases.

# New Features

* [Support](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8390) for 
  [experimental endorsement](https://github.com/lightning/blips/pull/27) 
  signal relay was added. This signal has *no impact* on routing, and
  is deployed experimentally to assist ongoing channel jamming research.

## Functional Enhancements
## RPC Additions

* [Add a new rpc endpoint](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8843)
  `BumpForceCloseFee` which moves the functionality soley available in the
  `lncli` to LND hence making it more universal.

## lncli Additions

* [A pre-generated macaroon root key can now be specified in `lncli create` and
  `lncli createwatchonly`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9172) to
  allow for deterministic macaroon generation.

# Improvements
## Functional Updates

* [Allow](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9017) the compression of logs during rotation with ZSTD via the `logcompressor` startup argument.

* The SCB file now [contains more data][https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8183]
  that enable a last resort rescue for certain cases where the peer is no longer
  around.

* LND updates channel.backup file at shutdown time.

## RPC Updates

## lncli Updates

## Code Health

* [Moved](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9138) profile related
  config settings to its own dedicated group. The old ones still work but will
  be removed in a future release.
 
* [Update to use structured 
  logging](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9083). This also 
  introduces a new `--logging.console.disable` option to disable logs being 
  written to stdout and a new `--logging.file.disable` option to disable writing 
  logs to the standard log file. It also adds `--logging.console.no-timestamps`
  and `--logging.file.no-timestamps` which can be used to omit timestamps in
  log messages for the respective loggers. The new `--logging.console.call-site`
  and `--logging.file.call-site` options can be used to include the call-site of
  a log line. The options for this include "off" (default), "short" (source file
  name and line number) and "long" (full path to source file and line number). 
  Finally, the new `--logging.console.style` option can be used under the `dev` 
  build tag to add styling to console logging.
 
## Breaking Changes
## Performance Improvements

* Log rotation can now use ZSTD 

* [A new method](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9195)
  `AssertTxnsNotInMempool` has been added to `lntest` package to allow batch
  exclusion check in itest.

# Technical and Architectural Updates
## BOLT Spec Updates

* Add new [lnwire](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8044) messages
  for the Gossip 1.75 protocol.

## Testing
## Database

* [Migrate the mission control 
  store](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8911) to use a more 
  minimal encoding for payment attempt routes.

* [Migrate the mission control 
  store](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9001) so that results are 
  namespaced. All existing results are written to the "default" namespace.

## Code Health

## Tooling and Documentation

* [Improved `lncli create` command help text](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9077)
  by replacing the word `argument` with `input` in the command description,
  clarifying that the command requires interactive inputs rather than arguments.
