# Bug Fixes

- [Fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10097) a deadlock that
  could occur when multiple goroutines attempted to send gossip filter backlog
  messages simultaneously. The fix ensures only a single goroutine processes the
  backlog at any given time using an atomic flag.

- [Fix](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10107) a bug where child
  logger's derived via `WithPrefix` did not inherit change log level changes
  from their parent loggers.

- Fixed a [deadlock](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10108) that
  can cause contract resolvers to be stuck at marking the channel force close as
  being complete.

- [Fixed a bug in `btcwallet` that caused issues with Tapscript addresses being
  imported in a watch-only (e.g. remote-signing)
  setup](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10119).

- [Fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10125) a case in the
  payment lifecycle where we would retry the same route over and over again in
  situations where the sending amount would violate the channel policy
  restriction (min,max HTLC).

- [Fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10141) a case where we
  would not resolve all outstanding payment attempts after the overall payment
  lifecycle was canceled due to a timeout.

# New Features

## Functional Enhancements

* The default value for `gossip.msg-rate-bytes` has been
  [increased](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10096) from 100KB to
  1MB, and `gossip.msg-burst-bytes` has been increased from 200KB to 2MB.

- Previously, when sweeping non-time sensitive anchor outputs, they might be
  grouped with other non-time sensitive outputs such as `to_local` outputs,
  which potentially allow the sweeping tx to be pinned. This is now
  [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10117) by moving sweeping
  anchors into its own tx, which means the anchor outputs won't be swept in a
  high fee environment.
