# Bug Fixes

- Fixed potential update inconsistencies in node announcements [by creating
  a shallow copy before modifications](
  https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9815). This ensures the original
  announcement remains unchanged until the new one is fully signed and
  validated.

- Fixed [shutdown deadlock](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10042)
  when we fail starting up LND before we startup the chanbackup sub-server.

- Fixed BOLT-11 invoice parsing behavior: [now errors](
  https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9993) are returned when receiving
  empty route hints or a non-UTF-8-encoded description.

- [Fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10027) an issue where
  known TLV fields were incorrectly encoded into the `ExtraData` field of
  messages in the dynamic commitment set.


# New Features

- Added [NoOp HTLCs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9871). This
allows sending HTLCs to the remote party without shifting the balances of the
channel. This is currently only possible to use with custom channels, and only
when the appropriate TLV flag is set. This allows for HTLCs carrying metadata to
reflect their state on the channel commitment without having to send or receive
a certain amount of msats.

## Functional Enhancements

* RPCs `walletrpc.EstimateFee` and `walletrpc.FundPsbt` now
   [allow](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10087)
  `conf_target=1`. Previously they required `conf_target >= 2`.

## RPC Additions
* When querying [`ForwardingEvents`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9813)
logs, the response now include the incoming and outgoing htlc indices of the payment 
circuit. The indices are only available for forwarding events saved after v0.20.


* The `lncli addinvoice --blind` command now has the option to include a
  chained channels [1](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9127)
  [2](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9925)
  incoming list `--blinded_path_incoming_channel_list` which gives users the 
  control of specifying the channels they prefer to receive the payment on. With
  the option to specify multiple channels this control can be extended to
  multiple hops leading to the node.


* The `lnrpc.ForwardingHistory` RPC method now supports filtering by 
  [`incoming_chan_ids` and `outgoing_chan_ids`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9356). 
  This allows to retrieve forwarding events for specific channels.


* `DescribeGraph`, `GetNodeInfo`, `GetChanInfo` and the corresponding lncli
   commands [now have flag](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9950)
  `include_auth_proof`. With the flag, these APIs add AuthProof (signatures from
  the channel announcement) to the returned ChannelEdge.

* A [new config](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10001) value
  `--htlcswitch.quiescencetimeout` is added to allow specifying the max duration
  the channel can be quiescent. A minimal value of 30s is enforced, and a
  default value of 60s is used. This value is used to limit the dependent
  protocols like dynamic commitments by restricting that the operation must
  finish under this timeout value. Consider using a larger timeout value if you
  have a slow network.

* Added [`deletecanceledinvoices`](
  https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9625) RPC to allow the removal of
  a canceled invoice. Supports deleting a canceled invoice by providing its
  payment hash.

## lncli Additions

* [`lncli sendpayment` and `lncli queryroutes` now support the
  `--route_hints` flag](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9721) to
  support routing through private channels.


* The `lncli fwdinghistory` command now supports two new flags:
  [`--incoming_chan_ids` and `--outgoing_chan_ids`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9356).
  These filters allows to query forwarding events for specific channels.

# Improvements
## Functional Updates

* Graph Store SQL implementation and migration project:
  * Introduce an [abstract graph 
    store](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9791) interface. 
  * Start [validating](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9787) that 
    byte blobs at the end of gossip messages are valid TLV streams.
  * Various [preparations](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9692) 
    of the graph code before the SQL implementation is added.
  * Only [fetch required 
    fields](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9923) during graph 
    cache population. 
  * Add graph schemas, queries and CRUD:
    * [1](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9866)
    * [2](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9869)
    * [3](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9887)
    * [4](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9931)
    * [5](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9935)
    * [6](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9936)
    * [7](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9937)
    * [8](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9938)
    * [9](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9939)
    * [10](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9971)
    * [11](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9972)
  * Add graph SQL migration logic:
    * [1](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10036)
    * [2](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10050)
    * [3](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10038)

## RPC Updates
* Previously the `RoutingPolicy` would return the inbound fee record in its
  `CustomRecords` field, which is duplicated info as it's already presented in
  fields `InboundFeeBaseMsat` and `InboundFeeRateMilliMsat`. This is now
  [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9572), the affected RPCs
  are `SubscribeChannelGraph`, `GetChanInfo`, `GetNodeInfo` and `DescribeGraph`.

* [Fix a bug](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10064) where the
  `GetChanInfo` was not returning the correct gRPC status code in the cases 
  where the channel is unknown to the node. The same is done for `LookupInvoice`
  for the case where the DB is kvdb backed and no invoices have yet been added
  to the database.

## lncli Updates
* Previously, users could only specify one `outgoing_chan_id` when calling the 
  `lncli queryroutes` or the QueryRoutes RPC. With this change, multiple 
  `outgoing_chan_id` can be passed during the call.


## Code Health

- [Increase itest coverage](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9990)
for payments. Now the payment address is mandatory for the writer and
reader of a payment request.

- [Refactored](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10018) `channelLink`
  to improve readability and maintainability of the code.

## Breaking Changes

## Deprecations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** The following RPCs will be removed in release version **0.21**:

| Deprecated RPC Method | REST Equivalent | HTTP Method | Path | Replaced By |
|----------------------|----------------|-------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| [`lnrpc.SendToRoute`](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/lnd/lightning/send-to-route/index.html) <br> [`routerrpc.SendToRoute`](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/lnd/router/send-to-route/) | ‚ùå (No direct REST equivalent) | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | [`routerrpc.SendToRouteV2`](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/lnd/router/send-to-route-v2/) |

üö® **Users are strongly encouraged** to transition to the new **V2 methods** before release **0.21** to ensure compatibility:

| New RPC Method | REST Equivalent | HTTP Method | Path |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| [`routerrpc.SendToRouteV2`](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/lnd/router/send-to-route-v2/) | ‚úÖ | `POST` | `/v2/router/route/send` |
| [`routerrpc.SendPaymentV2`](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/lnd/router/send-payment-v2/index.html) | ‚úÖ | `POST` | `/v2/router/send` |
| [`routerrpc.TrackPaymentV2`](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/lnd/router/track-payment-v2/) | ‚úÖ | `GET` | `/v2/router/track/{payment_hash}` |

* We are deprecating `OutgoingChanId` in favour of `OutgoingChanIds` in the
  `QueryRoutes` RPC. This [transition](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10057) allows us to specify more than one outgoing channel
  the pathfinder should use when finding a route.

# Technical and Architectural Updates
## BOLT Spec Updates

* Explicitly define the [inbound fee TLV 
  record](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9897) on the 
  `channel_update` message and handle it explicitly throughout the code base 
  instead of extracting it from the TLV stream at various call-sites.

* [Require invoices to include a payment address or blinded paths](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9752) 
  to comply with updated BOLT 11 specifications before sending payments.

* [Support DNS address in
  node announcement msg](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10159):
  This update allows users to announce their LND node using a DNS address in
  the node announcement message, by configuring `external-dns-address` field in
  the LND config file.
  **Note:** According to BOLT 07, only one DNS address may be announced per
  node.

## Testing

* Previously, automatic peer bootstrapping was disabled for simnet, signet and
  regtest networks even if the `--nobootstrap` flag was not set. This automatic
  disabling has now been 
  [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/9967) meaning that any 
  test network scripts that rely on bootstrapping being disabled will need to 
  explicitly define the `--nobootstrap` flag. Bootstrapping will now also be
  [deterministic](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10003) on local 
  test networks so that bootstrapping behaviour can be tested for.

## Database

* Add missing [sql index](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10155)
  for settled invoices to increase query speed.
