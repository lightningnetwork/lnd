# Bug Fixes

* Bitcoind outbound peer health checks [now use](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10686)
  `getnetworkinfo.connections_out` instead of `getpeerinfo`. The same PR also
  [clarifies](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/10568) the ZMQ
  port-mismatch warnings so they no longer suggest that the connection failed.

* The sweeper [now leases wallet UTXOs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10816)
  it claims for fee-paying inputs, preventing concurrent sweeps within a
  single node from contending for the same UTXO. It also no longer
  ratchets the starting fee rate on failures that are not fee-related
  (e.g. when there are no UTXOs available to cover the fees), so inputs
  whose intrinsic budget cannot accommodate a higher rate are not
  stranded. This resolves [#7397](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/7397)
  and addresses item 3 of [#8680](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/8680).

# New Features

## Functional Enhancements

## RPC Additions

* The `routerrpc.EstimateRouteFee` RPC now supports [restricting fee estimates
  to specific first-hop outgoing
  channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10501) via the new
  `outgoing_chan_ids` field in `RouteFeeRequest`.

## lncli Additions

* The `estimateroutefee` command now supports [restricting fee estimates to
  specific first-hop outgoing
  channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10501) via the new
  `--outgoing_chan_id` flag.

# Technical and Architectural Updates

## BOLT Spec Updates

* The fundee now [enforces the BOLT-02 bound on
  `push_msat`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/10765),
  rejecting incoming `open_channel` messages where `push_msat` exceeds
  `1000 * funding_satoshis`. Oversized pushes were previously caught
  later in the reservation flow as a funder-balance-dust error; they now
  surface a clearer, spec-aligned error string up front.
