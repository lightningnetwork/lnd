# LND Sweeper Fee Bump Test Implementation

This gist contains the implementation of a fee bumping test for the LND sweeper component. It includes:

1. `competency_test_summary.md` - A detailed explanation of the test implementation, improvements made, and verification points
2. `lnd_sweeper_fee_bump_test.go` - The actual test code implementation

The test verifies the sweeper's ability to properly increase transaction fees to ensure timely confirmation of transactions in the mempool. Key aspects tested include:
- Initial fee rate setting
- Monotonic fee rate increases
- Maximum fee rate compliance

The implementation includes several improvements:
- Enhanced context handling with timeouts
- Better error handling and messages
- Improved code organization
- Proper cleanup procedures

To run the test:
1. Ensure you have a running LND node
2. The test will automatically use Alice's node
3. The test will create and monitor transactions in the mempool
4. Results will be logged showing fee rate increases

Test parameters:
- Max fee rate: 50 sat/vbyte
- Test timeout: 30 seconds
- Max test duration: 5 minutes
- Polling interval: 1 second
