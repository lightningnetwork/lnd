// HtlcNotifier notifies clients of htlc forwards, failures and settles for
// htlcs that the switch handles. It takes subscriptions for its events and
// notifies them when htlc events occur. These are served on a best-effort
// basis; events are not persisted, delivery is not guaranteed (in the event
// of a crash in the switch, forward events may be lost) and some events may
// be replayed upon restart. Events consumed from this package should be
// de-duplicated by the htlc's unique combination of incoming+outgoing circuit
// and not relied upon for critical operations.
//
// The htlc notifier sends the following kinds of events:
// Forwarding Event:
// - Represents a htlc which is forwarded onward from our node.
// - Present for htlc forwards through our node and local sends.
//
// Link Failure Event:
// - Indicates that a htlc has failed on our incoming or outgoing link,
//   with an incoming boolean which indicates where the failure occurred.
// - Incoming link failures are present for failed attempts to pay one of
//   our invoices (insufficient amount or mpp timeout, for example) and for
//   forwards that we cannot decode to forward onwards.
// - Outgoing link failures are present for forwards or local payments that
//   do not meet our outgoing link's policy (insufficient fees, for example)
//   and when we fail to forward the payment on (insufficient outgoing
//   capacity, or an unknown outgoing link).
//
// Forwarding Failure Event:
// - Forwarding failures indicate that a htlc we forwarded has failed at
//   another node down the route.
// - Present for local sends and htlc forwards which fail after they left
//   our node.
//
// Settle event:
// - Settle events are present when a htlc which we added is settled through
//   the release of a preimage.
// - Present for local receives, and successful local sends or forwards.
//
// Each htlc is identified by its incoming and outgoing circuit key. Htlcs,
// and their subsequent settles or fails, can be identified by the combination
// of incoming and outgoing circuits. Note that receives to our node will
// have a zero outgoing circuit key because the htlc terminates at our
// node, and sends from our node will have a zero incoming circuit key because
// the send originates at our node.
