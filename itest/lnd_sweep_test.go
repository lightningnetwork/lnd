// testSweepAnchorCPFPLocalForceClose checks when a channel is force closed by
// a local node with a time-sensitive HTLC, the anchor output is used for
// CPFPing the force close tx.
//
// Setup:
//  1. Fund Alice with 2 UTXOs - she will need two to sweep her anchors from
//     the local and remote commitments, with one of them being invalid.
//  2. Fund Bob with no UTXOs - his sweeping txns don't need wallet utxos as he
//     doesn't need to sweep any time-sensitive outputs.
//  3. Alice opens a channel with Bob, and sends him an HTLC without being
//     settled - we achieve this by letting Bob hold the preimage, which means
//     he will consider his incoming HTLC has no preimage.
//  4. Alice force closes the channel.
//
// Test:
//  1. Alice's force close tx should be CPFPed using the anchor output.
//  2. Bob attempts to sweep his anchor output and fails due to it's
//     uneconomical.
//  3. Alice's RBF attempt is using the fee rates calculated from the deadline
//     and budget.
//  4. Wallet UTXOs requirements are met - for Alice she needs at least 2, and
//     Bob he needs none.
