// commitQueue is a simple execution queue to manage conflicts for transactions
// and thereby reduce the number of times conflicting transactions need to be
// retried. When a new transaction is added to the queue, we first upgrade the
// read/write counts in the queue's own accounting to decide whether the new
// transaction has any conflicting dependencies. If the transaction does not
// conflict with any other, then it is comitted immediately, otherwise it'll be
// queued up for later exection.
// The algorithm is described in: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~abadi/papers/vll-vldb13.pdf
