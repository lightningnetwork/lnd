    the standard BIP-0049 derivation scheme, while a witness address type will

    pubkeys everywhere) and our own BIP-0049Plus address schema (nested pubkeys

    /* lncli: `wallet bumpfee`
    BumpFee is an endpoint that allows users to interact with lnd's sweeper
    directly. It takes an outpoint from an unconfirmed transaction and sends it
    to the sweeper for potential fee bumping. Depending on whether the outpoint
    has been registered in the sweeper (an existing input, e.g., an anchor
    output) or not (a new input, e.g., an unconfirmed wallet utxo), this will
    either be an RBF or CPFP attempt.

    When receiving an input, lnd’s sweeper needs to understand its time
    sensitivity to make economical fee bumps - internally a fee function is
    created using the deadline and budget to guide the process. When the
    deadline is approaching, the fee function will increase the fee rate and
    perform an RBF.

    When a force close happens, all the outputs from the force closing
    transaction will be registered in the sweeper. The sweeper will then handle
    the creation, publish, and fee bumping of the sweeping transactions.
    Everytime a new block comes in, unless the sweeping transaction is
    confirmed, an RBF is attempted. To interfere with this automatic process,
    users can use BumpFee to specify customized fee rate, budget, deadline, and
    whether the sweep should happen immediately. It's recommended to call
    `ListSweeps` to understand the shape of the existing sweeping transaction
    first - depending on the number of inputs in this transaction, the RBF
    requirements can be quite different.

    This RPC also serves useful when wanting to perform a Child-Pays-For-Parent
    (CPFP), where the child transaction pays for its parent's fee. This can be
    done by specifying an outpoint within the low fee transaction that is under
    the control of the wallet.

    /* lncli: `wallet psbt fund`
    FundPsbt creates a fully populated PSBT that contains enough inputs to fund
    the outputs specified in the template. There are three ways a user can
    specify what we call the template (a list of inputs and outputs to use in
    the PSBT): Either as a PSBT packet directly with no coin selection (using
    the legacy "psbt" field), a PSBT with advanced coin selection support (using
    the new "coin_select" field) or as a raw RPC message (using the "raw"
    field).
    The legacy "psbt" and "raw" modes, the following restrictions apply:
          1. If there are no inputs specified in the template, coin selection is
          performed automatically.
          2. If the template does contain any inputs, it is assumed that full
    coin selection happened externally and no additional inputs are added. If
    the specified inputs aren't enough to fund the outputs with the given fee
          rate, an error is returned.

    The new "coin_select" mode does not have these restrictions and allows the
    user to specify a PSBT with inputs and outputs and still perform coin
    selection on top of that.
    For all modes this RPC requires any inputs that are specified to be locked
    by the user (if they belong to this node in the first place).

    After either selecting or verifying the inputs, all input UTXOs are locked
    with an internal app ID.

    NOTE: If this method returns without an error, it is the caller's
