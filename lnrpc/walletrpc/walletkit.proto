    any point with the addition of new inputs. The list of inputs that
    currently exist within lnd's central batching engine can be retrieved

    When bumping the fee of an input that currently exists within lnd's central
    batching engine, a higher fee transaction will be created that replaces the
    lower fee transaction through the Replace-By-Fee (RBF) policy. If it

    This RPC also serves useful when wanting to perform a Child-Pays-For-Parent
    (CPFP), where the child transaction pays for its parent's fee. This can be
    done by specifying an outpoint within the low fee transaction that is under
    the control of the wallet.

    The fee preference can be expressed either as a specific fee rate or a delta
    of blocks in which the output should be swept on-chain within. If a fee
    preference is not explicitly specified, then an error is returned.

    Note that this RPC currently doesn't perform any validation checks on the
    fee preference being provided. For now, the responsibility of ensuring that
    the new fee preference is sufficient is delegated to the user.
