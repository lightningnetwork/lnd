The lnwallet package implements an abstracted wallet controller that is able to
drive channel funding workflows, a number of script utilities, witness
generation functions for the various Lightning scripts, revocation key
derivation, and the commitment update state machine. 

The package is used within `lnd` as the core wallet of the daemon. The wallet
itself is composed of several distinct interfaces that decouple the
implementation of things like signing and blockchain access. This separation
allows new `WalletController` implementations to be easily dropped into
`lnd` without disrupting the code base. A series of integration tests at the
interface level are also in place to ensure conformance of the implementation
with the interface.
