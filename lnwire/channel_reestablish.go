// ChannelReestablish is a message sent between peers that have an existing
// open channel upon connection reestablishment. This message allows both sides
// to report their local state, and their current knowledge of the state of the
// remote commitment chain. If a deviation is detected and can be recovered
// from, then the necessary messages will be retransmitted. If the level of
// desynchronization is irreconcilable, then the channel will be force closed.
