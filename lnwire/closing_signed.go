// ClosingSigned is sent by both parties to a channel once the channel is clear
// of HTLCs, and is primarily concerned with negotiating fees for the close
// transaction. Each party provides a signature for a transaction with a fee
// that they believe is fair. The process terminates when both sides agree on
// the same fee, or when one side force closes the channel.
//
// NOTE: The responder is able to send a signature without any additional
// messages as all transactions are assembled observing BIP 69 which defines a
// canonical ordering for input/outputs. Therefore, both sides are able to
// arrive at an identical closure transaction as they know the order of the
// inputs/outputs.
