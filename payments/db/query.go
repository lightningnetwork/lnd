// Query represents a query to the payments database starting or ending

	// IndexOffset. In the case of a zero index_offset, the query will start
	// with the oldest payment when paginating forwards, or will end with
	// the most recent payment when paginating backwards.

	// true, the query will fetch payments with indices lower than the
	// IndexOffset, otherwise, it will return payments with indices greater
	// than the IndexOffset.
	Reversed bool

	// If IncludeIncomplete is true, then return payments that have not yet
	// fully completed. This means that pending payments, as well as failed
	// payments will show up if this field is set to true.

// Response contains the result of a query to the payments database.

	// response. The offset can be used to continue reverse pagination.
