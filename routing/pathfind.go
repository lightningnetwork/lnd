// getProbabilityBasedDist converts a weight into a distance that takes into

// Derivation:
//
// Suppose there are two routes A and B with fees Fa and Fb and success
// probabilities Pa and Pb.
//
// Is the expected cost of trying route A first and then B lower than trying the
// other way around?
//
// The expected cost of A-then-B is: Pa*Fa + (1-Pa)*Pb*(c+Fb)
//
// The expected cost of B-then-A is: Pb*Fb + (1-Pb)*Pa*(c+Fa)
//
// In these equations, the term representing the case where both A and B fail is
// left out because its value would be the same in both cases.
//
// Pa*Fa + (1-Pa)*Pb*(c+Fb) < Pb*Fb + (1-Pb)*Pa*(c+Fa)
//
// Pa*Fa + Pb*c + Pb*Fb - Pa*Pb*c - Pa*Pb*Fb < Pb*Fb + Pa*c + Pa*Fa - Pa*Pb*c - Pa*Pb*Fa
//
// Removing terms that cancel out:
// Pb*c - Pa*Pb*Fb < Pa*c - Pa*Pb*Fa
//
// Divide by Pa*Pb:
// c/Pa - Fb < c/Pb - Fa
//
// Move terms around:
// Fa + c/Pa < Fb + c/Pb
//
// So the value of F + c/P can be used to compare routes.
