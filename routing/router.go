	// The incoming amount Ai based on the outgoing amount Ao is computed by
	// Ai = max(Ai(Ao), Ao), which caps the incoming amount such that the
	// total node fee (Ai - Ao) is non-negative. This is commonly enforced
	// by routing nodes.

	// The function Ai(Ao) is given by:
	// Ai(Ao) = (Ao + Bo + Ro/PPM) + (Bi + (Ao + Ro/PPM + Bo)*Ri/PPM), where
	// the first term is the net amount (the outgoing amount plus the
	// outbound fee), and the second is the inbound fee computed based on
	// the net amount.

	// Ai(Ao) can potentially become more negative in absolute value than
	// Ao, which is why the above mentioned capping is needed. We can
	// abbreviate Ai(Ao) with Ai(Ao) = m*Ao + n, where m and n are:
	// m := (1 + Ro/PPM) * (1 + Ri/PPM)
	// n := Bi + Bo*(1 + Ri/PPM)

	// If we know that m > 0, this is equivalent of Ri/PPM > -1, because Ri
	// is the only factor that can become negative. A value or Ri/PPM = -1,
	// means that the routing node is willing to give up on 100% of the
	// net amount (based on the fee rate), which is likely to not happen in
	// practice. This condition will be important for a later trick.

	// If we want to compute the incoming amount based on the outgoing
	// amount, which is the reverse problem, we need to solve Ai =
	// max(Ai(Ao), Ao) for Ao(Ai). Given an incoming amount A,
	// we look for an Ao such that A = max(Ai(Ao), Ao).

	// The max function separates this into two cases. The case to take is
	// not clear yet, because we don't know Ao, but later we see a trick
	// how to determine which case is the one to take.

	// first case: Ai(Ao) <= Ao:
	// Therefore, A = max(Ai(Ao), Ao) = Ao, we find Ao = A.
	// This also leads to Ai(A) <= A by substitution into the condition.

	// second case: Ai(Ao) > Ao:
	// Therefore, A = max(Ai(Ao), Ao) = Ai(Ao) = m*Ao + n. Solving for Ao
	// gives Ao = (A - n)/m.
	//
	// We know
	// Ai(Ao) > Ao  <=>  A = Ai(Ao) > Ao = (A - n)/m,
	// so A > (A - n)/m.
	//
	// **Assuming m > 0**, by multiplying with m, we can transform this to
	// A * m + n > A.
	//
	// We know Ai(A) = A*m + n, therefore Ai(A) > A.
	//
	// This means that if we apply the incoming amount calculation to the
	// **incoming** amount, and this condition holds, then we know that we
	// deal with the second case, being able to compute the outgoing amount
	// based off the formula Ao = (A - n)/m, otherwise we will just return
	// the incoming amount.
