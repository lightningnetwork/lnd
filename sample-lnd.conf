; Adding an external IP will advertise your node to the network. This signals
; that your node is available to accept incoming channels. If you don't wish to
; advertise your node, this value doesn't need to be set. Unless specified
; (with host:port notation), the default port (9735) will be added to the
; address.
;
; NOTE: If you previously set one or more `externalip` entries and later
; remove `externalip` entirely from the config, lnd will continue to advertise
; the last known addresses from the previous run (they are stored with your node
; information). To stop advertising them, remove those addresses explicitly
; using the peers RPC/CLI, for example:
;   `lncli peers updatenodeannouncement --address_remove=1.2.3.4:9735`
; A restart is not required, a new node announcement will be broadcasted.
; externalip=
;
; Instead of explicitly stating your external IP address, you can also enable
; UPnP or NAT-PMP support on the daemon. Both techniques will be tried and
; require proper hardware support. In order to detect this hardware support,
; `lnd` uses a dependency that retrieves the router's gateway address by using
; different built-in binaries in each platform. Therefore, it is possible that
; we are unable to detect the hardware and `lnd` will exit with an error
; indicating this. This option will automatically retrieve your external IP
; address, even after it has changed in the case of dynamic IPs, and advertise
; it to the network using the ports the daemon is listening on. This does not

; dust-threshold=

; This value replaces the old 'dust-threshold' setting and defines the maximum
; amount of satoshis that a channel pays in fees in case the commitment 
; transaction is broadcasted. This is enforced in both directions either when
; we are the channel intiator hence paying the fees but also applies to the 
; channel fee if we are NOT the channel initiator. It is
; important to note that every HTLC adds fees to the channel state. Non-dust 
; HTLCs add just a new output onto the commitment transaction whereas dust 
; HTLCs are completely attributed the commitment fee. So this limit can also 
; influence adding new HTLCs onto the state. When the limit is reached we won't 
; allow any new HTLCs onto the channel state (outgoing and incoming). So 
; choosing a right limit here must be done with caution. Moreover this is a 
; limit for all channels universally meaning there is no difference made due to
; the channel size. So it is recommended to use the default value. However if
; you have a very small channel average size you might want to reduce this 
; value.
; WARNING: Setting this value too low might cause force closes because the

;   protocol.custom-nodeann=
; Example:
;   protocol.custom-nodeann=39

; Specifies custom feature bits — numbers defined in BOLT 9 — to advertise in
; the node's invoices. Note that you can set this option as many times as you
; want to support more than one feature bit.
; Default:
;   protocol.custom-invoice=
; Example:
;   protocol.custom-invoice=39

[db]

; The selected database backend. The current default backend is "bolt". lnd
; also has experimental support for etcd, a replicated backend, postgres and
; sqlite.
; db.backend=bolt

; The maximum interval the graph database will wait between attempting to flush
; a batch of modifications to disk.
; db.batch-commit-interval=500ms

; Don't use the in-memory graph cache for path finding. Much slower but uses
; less RAM. Can only be used with a bolt database backend.
; db.no-graph-cache=false

; Specify whether the optional migration for pruning old revocation logs
; should be applied. This migration will only save disk space if there are open
; channels prior to lnd@v0.15.0.

; sphinx logs should be applied. By default, the decayed log will be garbage
; collected.
; db.no-gc-decayed-log=false

; If set to true, then the to-local and to-remote output amount data of revoked
; commitment transactions will not be stored in the revocation log. Note that

; the future.
; db.no-rev-log-amt-data=false

; If set to true, native SQL will be used instead of KV emulation for tables
; that support it.
; Subsystems which support native SQL tables:
; - Invoices
; - Graph
; db.use-native-sql=false

; If set to true, the KV to native SQL migration will be skipped. Note that
; this option is intended for users who experience non-resolvable migration
; errors. Enabling after there is a non-resolvable migration error that resulted
; in an incomplete migration will cause that partial migration to be abandoned
; and ignored and an empty database will be used instead. Since invoices are
; currently the only native SQL database used, our channels will still work but
; the invoice history will be forgotten. This option has no effect if native SQL
; is not in use (db.use-native-sql=false).
; db.skip-native-sql-migration=false

[etcd]

;   db.postgres.maxconnections=50
; Example:
;   db.postgres.maxconnections=

; Whether to skip executing schema migrations.
; db.postgres.skipmigrations=false

; Use a global lock for channeldb access. This ensures only a single writer at
; a time but reduces concurrency. This is a temporary workaround until the
; revocation log is migrated to native SQL.
; db.postgres.channeldb-with-global-lock=false


; Use a global lock for wallet database access. This is a temporary workaround 
; until the wallet subsystem is upgraded to a native sql schema.

; Whether to skip executing schema migrations.
; db.sqlite.skipmigrations=false

[bolt]

; If true, prevents the database from syncing its freelist to disk.
; db.bolt.nofreelistsync=false
;
; Whether the databases used within lnd should automatically be compacted on
; every startup (and if the database has the configured minimum age). This is
; disabled by default because it requires additional disk space to be available
; during the compaction that is freed afterwards. In general compaction leads to
; smaller database files.
; db.bolt.auto-compact=false

; How long ago the last compaction of a database file must be for it to be
; considered for auto compaction again. Can be set to 0 to compact on every
; startup. 
; Default:
;   db.bolt.auto-compact-min-age=168h
; Example:

; Time after which a RPC middleware intercept request will time out and return
; an error if it hasn't yet received a response.
; rpcmiddleware.intercepttimeout=2s

; Add the named middleware to the list of mandatory middlewares. All RPC
; requests are blocked/denied if any of the mandatory middlewares is not
; registered. Can be specified multiple times.
; Default:
;   rpcmiddleware.addmandatory=
; Example:
;   rpcmiddleware.addmandatory=my-example-middleware
;   rpcmiddleware.addmandatory=other-mandatory-middleware


[remotesigner]

; Use a remote signer for signing any on-chain related transactions or messages.
; Only recommended if local wallet is initialized as watch-only. Remote signer
; must use the same seed/root key as the local watch-only wallet but must have
; private keys.
; remotesigner.enable=false

; The remote signer's RPC host:port.
; Default:
;   remotesigner.rpchost=
; Example:
;   remotesigner.rpchost=remote.signer.lnd.host:10009

; WARNING: This cannot be undone! Make sure you have backed up your seed before
; you use this flag! All private keys will be purged from the wallet after first
; unlock with this flag!
; remotesigner.migrate-wallet-to-watch-only=false


[gossip]

; Specify a set of pinned gossip syncers, which will always be actively syncing
; whenever the corresponding peer is online. A pinned syncer does not count
; towards the configured `numgraphsyncpeers` since pinned syncers are not
; rotated. Configuring a pinned syncer does not ensure a persistent connection
; to the target peer, they will only be pinned if the connection remains active
; via some other mechanism, e.g. having an open channel.
;
; This feature is useful when trying to ensure that a node keeps its
; routing table tightly synchronized with a set of remote peers, e.g. multiple
; lightning nodes operated by the same service.
;
; Each value should be a hex-encoded pubkey of the pinned peer. Multiple pinned
; peers can be specified by setting multiple flags/fields in the config.
; Default:
;   gossip.pinned-syncers=
; Example:
;   gossip.pinned-syncers=pubkey1
;   gossip.pinned-syncers=pubkey2

; The maximum number of updates for a specific channel and direction that lnd
; will accept over the channel update interval.
; gossip.max-channel-update-burst=10
; gossip.channel-update-interval=1m

; The duration to wait before sending the next announcement batch if there are
; multiple. Use a small value if there are a lot announcements and they need to
; be broadcast quickly.
; gossip.sub-batch-delay=5s

; The number of confirmations required before processing channel announcements.
; gossip.announcement-conf=6

; The total rate of outbound gossip messages, expressed in bytes per second.
; This setting controls the long-term average speed of gossip traffic sent from
; your node. The rate limit is applied globally across all peers, not per-peer.
; If the rate of outgoing messages exceeds this value, lnd will start to queue
; and delay messages to stay within the limit.
; gossip.msg-rate-bytes=1024000

; The maximum burst of outbound gossip data, in bytes, that can be sent at once.
; This works in conjunction with `gossip.msg-rate-bytes` as part of a token
; bucket rate-limiting scheme. This value represents the size of the token
; bucket. It allows for short, high-speed bursts of traffic, with the long-term
; rate controlled by `gossip.msg-rate-bytes`. This value must be larger than the
; maximum lightning message size (~65KB) to allow sending large gossip messages.
; gossip.msg-burst-bytes=2048000

; The maximum number of concurrent gossip filter applications that can be
; processed. Increase this value to handle more simultaneous peer
; synchronizations at the cost of additional resource usage.
; See docs/gossip_rate_limiting.md for mor information.
; gossip.filter-concurrency=5

; The score at which a peer is banned. Each time a peer sends a gossip message
; that is considered invalid, its ban score is incremented. Once the score
; reaches this threshold, the peer is banned for a default of 48 hours, and we
; will no longer process gossip messages from them. This is a measure to
; protect the node from spam and misbehaving peers. Setting this value to 0
; disables banning completely.
;
; A gossip message can be considered invalid for several reasons, including:
; - Invalid signature on the announcement.
; - Stale timestamp, older than what we already have.
; - Too many channel updates for the same channel in a short period.
; - Announcing a channel that is not found on-chain.
; - Announcing a channel that has already been closed.
; - Announcing a channel with an invalid proof.
;
; gossip.ban-threshold=100

; The peer-specific rate of outbound gossip messages, expressed in bytes per
; second. This setting controls the long-term average speed of gossip traffic
; sent from your node. The rate limit is applied to each peer. If the rate of
; outgoing messages exceeds this value, lnd will start to queue and delay
; messages sending to that peer to stay within the limit.
; gossip.peer-msg-rate-bytes=51200

[invoices]

; If a hold invoice has accepted htlcs that reach their expiry height and are
; not timed out, the channel holding the htlc is force closed to resolve the
; invoice's htlcs. To prevent force closes, lnd automatically cancels these
; invoices before they reach their expiry height.
;
; Hold expiry delta describes the number of blocks before expiry that these
; invoices should be canceled. Setting this value to 0 will ensure that hold
; invoices can be settled right up until their expiry height, but will result
; in the channel they are on being force closed if they are not resolved before
; expiry.
;
; Lnd goes to chain before the expiry for a htlc is reached so that there is
; time to resolve it on chain. This value needs to be greater than the
; DefaultIncomingBroadcastDelta set by lnd, otherwise the channel will be force
; closed anyway. A warning will be logged on startup if this value is not large
; enough to prevent force closes.
; invoices.holdexpirydelta=12

[routing]

; DEPRECATED: This is now turned on by default for Neutrino (use
; neutrino.validatechannels=true to turn off) and shouldn't be used for any
; other backend!
; routing.assumechanvalid=false

; If set to true, then we'll prune a channel if only a single edge is seen as
; being stale. This results in a more compact channel graph, and also is helpful
; for neutrino nodes as it means they'll only maintain edges where both nodes are
; seen as being live from it's PoV.
; routing.strictgraphpruning=false

; The minimum number of real (non-dummy) blinded hops to select for a blinded
; path. This doesn't include our node, so if the maximum is 1, then the
; shortest paths will contain our node along with an introduction node hop.
; routing.blinding.min-num-real-hops=1

; The number of hops to include in a blinded path. This does not include
; our node, so if is is 1, then the path will at least contain our node along
; with an introduction node hop. If it is 0, then it will use this node as
; the introduction node. This number must be greater than or equal to the
; the number of real hops (invoices.blinding.min-num-real-hops). Any paths
; shorter than this number will be padded with dummy hops.
; routing.blinding.num-hops=2

; The maximum number of blinded paths to select and add to an invoice.
; routing.blinding.max-num-paths=3

; The amount by which to increase certain policy values of hops on a blinded
; path in order to add a probing buffer. The higher this multiplier, the more
; buffer is added to the policy values of hops along a blinded path meaning
; that if they were to increase their policy values before the blinded path
; expires, the better the chances that the path would still be valid meaning
; that the path is less prone to probing attacks. However, if the multiplier
; is too high, the resulting buffered fees might be too much for the payer.
; routing.blinding.policy-increase-multiplier=1.1

; The amount by which to decrease certain policy values of hops on a blinded
; path in order to add a probing buffer. The lower this multiplier, the more
; buffer is added to the policy values of hops along a blinded path meaning
; that if they were to increase their policy values before the blinded path
; expires, the better the chances that the path would still be valid meaning
; that the path is less prone to probing attacks. However, since this value
; is being applied to the MaxHTLC value of the route, the lower it is, the
; lower payment amount will need to be.
; routing.blinding.policy-decrease-multiplier=0.9

[sweeper]

; DEPRECATED: Duration of the sweep batch window. The sweep is held back during
; the batch window to allow more inputs to be added and thereby lower the fee
; per input.
; sweeper.batchwindowduration=30s

; The max fee rate in sat/vb which can be used when sweeping funds. Setting
; this value too low can result in transactions not being confirmed in time,
; causing HTLCs to expire hence potentially losing funds.
; sweeper.maxfeerate=1000

; The conf target to use when sweeping non-time-sensitive outputs. This is
; useful for sweeping outputs that are not time-sensitive, and can be swept at
; a lower fee rate.
; sweeper.nodeadlineconftarget=1008


; An optional config group that's used for the automatic sweep fee estimation.
; The Budget config gives options to limits ones fee exposure when sweeping
; unilateral close outputs and the fee rate calculated from budgets is capped
; at sweeper.maxfeerate. Check the budget config options for more details.
; sweeper.budget=

[sweeper.budget]

; the ratio (if set) will be capped at this value.
; sweeper.budget.anchorcpfp=

; The ratio of a special value to allocate as the budget to pay fees when 
; CPFPing a force close tx using the anchor output. The special value is the
; sum of all time-sensitive HTLCs on this commitment subtracted by their
; budgets.
; sweeper.budget.anchorcpfpratio=0.5

; The amount in satoshis to allocate as the budget to pay fees when sweeping a
; time-sensitive (first-level) HTLC. If set, the budget calculated using the

; The ratio of the value in a time-sensitive (first-level) HTLC to allocate as
; the budget to pay fees when sweeping it.
; sweeper.budget.deadlinehtlcratio=0.5

; The amount in satoshis to allocate as the budget to pay fees when sweeping a

; The ratio of the value in a non-time-sensitive (second-level) HTLC to
; allocate as the budget to pay fees when sweeping it.
; sweeper.budget.nodeadlinehtlcratio=0.5

[htlcswitch]

; The timeout value when delivering HTLCs to a channel link. Setting this value
; too small will result in local payment failures if large number of payments
; are sent over a short period.
; htlcswitch.mailboxdeliverytimeout=1m

; The max duration that the channel can be quiesced. Any dependent protocols
; (dynamic commitments, splicing, etc.) must finish their operations under this
; timeout value, otherwise the node will disconnect.
; htlcswitch.quiescencetimeout=1m

[grpc]

; How long the server waits on a gRPC stream with no activity before pinging the

; ping. Valid time units are {s, m, h}.
; grpc.client-ping-min-wait=5s

; If true, the server allows keepalive pings from the client even when there are

; connection open for future requests.
; grpc.client-allow-ping-without-stream=false


[pprof]

; Enable HTTP profiling on given port -- NOTE port must be between 1024 and
; 65536. The profile can be access at: http://localhost:<PORT>/debug/pprof/.
; You can also provide it as host:port to enable profiling for remote debugging.
; For example 0.0.0.0:<PORT> to enable profiling for all interfaces on the given
; port. The built-in profiler has minimal overhead, so it is recommended to
; enable it.
; pprof.profile=

; Write CPU profile to the specified file. This should only be used for 
; debugging because compared to running a pprof server this will record the cpu
; profile constantly from the start of the program until the shutdown.
; pprof.cpuprofile=

; Enable a blocking profile to be obtained from the profiling port. A blocking
; profile can show where goroutines are blocking (stuck on mutexes, I/O, etc).
; This takes a value from 0 to 1, with 0 turning off the setting, and 1 sampling
; every blocking event (it's a rate value). The blocking profile has high 
; overhead and is off by default even when running the pprof server. It should
; only be used for debugging.
; pprof.blockingprofile=0

; Enable a mutex profile to be obtained from the profiling port. A mutex 
; profile can show where goroutines are blocked on mutexes, and which mutexes
; have high contention.  This takes a value from 0 to 1, with 0 turning off the
; setting, and 1 sampling every mutex event (it's a rate value). The mutex
