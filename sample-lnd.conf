[gossip]

; Specify a set of pinned gossip syncers, which will always be actively syncing
; whenever the corresponding peer is online. A pinned syncer does not count
; towards the configured `numgraphsyncpeers` since pinned syncers are not

; This feature is useful when trying to ensure that a node keeps its
; routing table tightly synchronized with a set of remote peers, e.g. multiple

[invoices]

; If a hold invoice has accepted htlcs that reach their expiry height and are

; invoice's htlcs. To prevent force closes, lnd automatically cancels these 
; invoices before they reach their expiry height.
;
; Hold expiry delta describes the number of blocks before expiry that these 
; invoices should be canceled. Setting this value to 0 will ensure that hold
; invoices can be settled right up until their expiry height, but will result
; in the channel they are on being force closed if they are not resolved before
; expiry.
; 
; Lnd goes to chain before the expiry for a htlc is reached so that there is 
; time to resolve it on chain. This value needs to be greater than the 
; DefaultIncomingBroadcastDelta set by lnd, otherwise the channel will be force
; closed anyway. A warning will be logged on startup if this value is not large
