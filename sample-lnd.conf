[invoices]

; If a hold invoice has accepted htlcs that reach their expiry height and are
; not timed out, the channel holding the htlc is force closed to resolve the
; invoice's htlcs. To prevent force closes, lnd automatically cancels these
; invoices before they reach their expiry height.
;
; Hold expiry delta describes the number of blocks before expiry that these
; invoices should be canceled. Setting this value to 0 will ensure that hold
; invoices can be settled right up until their expiry height, but will result
; in the channel they are on being force closed if they are not resolved before
; expiry.
;
; Lnd goes to chain before the expiry for a htlc is reached so that there is
; time to resolve it on chain. This value needs to be greater than the
; DefaultIncomingBroadcastDelta set by lnd, otherwise the channel will be force
; closed anyway. A warning will be logged on startup if this value is not large
; enough to prevent force closes.

; invoices.holdexpirydelta=15


[routing]

; DEPRECATED: This is now turned on by default for Neutrino (use
; neutrino.validatechannels=true to turn off) and shouldn't be used for any
; other backend!
; routing.assumechanvalid=true

; If set to true, then we'll prune a channel if only a single edge is seen as
; being stale. This results in a more compact channel graph, and also is helpful
; for neutrino nodes as it means they'll only maintain edges where both nodes are
; seen as being live from it's PoV.
; routing.strictgraphpruning=true

[sweeper]

; Duration of the sweep batch window. The sweep is held back during the batch
; window to allow more inputs to be added and thereby lower the fee per input.
; sweeper.batchwindowduration=30s

[htlcswitch]

; The timeout value when delivering HTLCs to a channel link. Setting this value
; too small will result in local payment failures if large number of payments
; are sent over a short period.
; htlcswitch.mailboxdeliverytimeout=60s
