; db.bolt.nofreelistsync=false
;
; Whether the databases used within lnd should automatically be compacted on
; every startup (and if the database has the configured minimum age). This is
; disabled by default because it requires additional disk space to be available
; during the compaction that is freed afterwards. In general compaction leads to
; smaller database files.
; db.bolt.auto-compact=false

; How long ago the last compaction of a database file must be for it to be
; considered for auto compaction again. Can be set to 0 to compact on every
; startup. 
; Default:
;   db.bolt.auto-compact-min-age=168h

[remotesigner]

; Use a remote signer for signing any on-chain related transactions or messages.

; must use the same seed/root key as the local watch-only wallet but must have
; private keys.
; remotesigner.enable=false

; The remote signer's RPC host:port.
; Default:
;   remotesigner.rpchost=

; you use this flag! All private keys will be purged from the wallet after first
; unlock with this flag!
; remotesigner.migrate-wallet-to-watch-only=false


[gossip]

; Specify a set of pinned gossip syncers, which will always be actively syncing
; whenever the corresponding peer is online. A pinned syncer does not count
; towards the configured `numgraphsyncpeers` since pinned syncers are not
; rotated. Configuring a pinned syncer does not ensure a persistent connection
; to the target peer, they will only be pinned if the connection remains active
; via some other mechanism, e.g. having an open channel.
;
; This feature is useful when trying to ensure that a node keeps its
; routing table tightly synchronized with a set of remote peers, e.g. multiple
; lightning nodes operated by the same service.
;
; Each value should be a hex-encoded pubkey of the pinned peer. Multiple pinned
; peers can be specified by setting multiple flags/fields in the config.
; Default:
;   gossip.pinned-syncers=
; Example:
;   gossip.pinned-syncers=pubkey1
;   gossip.pinned-syncers=pubkey2

; multiple. Use a small value if there are a lot announcements and they need to
; be broadcast quickly.
; gossip.sub-batch-delay=5s


[invoices]

; If a hold invoice has accepted htlcs that reach their expiry height and are
; not timed out, the channel holding the htlc is force closed to resolve the
; invoice's htlcs. To prevent force closes, lnd automatically cancels these
; invoices before they reach their expiry height.
;
; Hold expiry delta describes the number of blocks before expiry that these
; invoices should be canceled. Setting this value to 0 will ensure that hold
; invoices can be settled right up until their expiry height, but will result
; in the channel they are on being force closed if they are not resolved before
; expiry.
;
; Lnd goes to chain before the expiry for a htlc is reached so that there is
; time to resolve it on chain. This value needs to be greater than the
; DefaultIncomingBroadcastDelta set by lnd, otherwise the channel will be force
; closed anyway. A warning will be logged on startup if this value is not large
; enough to prevent force closes.
; invoices.holdexpirydelta=12


[routing]

; DEPRECATED: This is now turned on by default for Neutrino (use
; neutrino.validatechannels=true to turn off) and shouldn't be used for any
; other backend!
; routing.assumechanvalid=false

; If set to true, then we'll prune a channel if only a single edge is seen as
; being stale. This results in a more compact channel graph, and also is helpful
; for neutrino nodes as it means they'll only maintain edges where both nodes are
; seen as being live from it's PoV.
; routing.strictgraphpruning=false


[sweeper]

; Duration of the sweep batch window. The sweep is held back during the batch
; window to allow more inputs to be added and thereby lower the fee per input.
; sweeper.batchwindowduration=30s


[htlcswitch]

; The timeout value when delivering HTLCs to a channel link. Setting this value
; too small will result in local payment failures if large number of payments
; are sent over a short period.
; htlcswitch.mailboxdeliverytimeout=1m


[grpc]

; How long the server waits on a gRPC stream with no activity before pinging the
; client. Valid time units are {s, m, h}.
; grpc.server-ping-time=1m

; How long the server waits for the response from the client for the keepalive
; ping response. Valid time units are {s, m, h}.
; grpc.server-ping-timeout=20s

; The minimum amount of time the client should wait before sending a keepalive
; ping. Valid time units are {s, m, h}.
; grpc.client-ping-min-wait=5s

; If true, the server allows keepalive pings from the client even when there are
; no active gRPC streams. This might be useful to keep the underlying HTTP/2
; connection open for future requests.
; grpc.client-allow-ping-without-stream=false
