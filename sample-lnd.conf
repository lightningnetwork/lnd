; ~/Library/Application Support/Lnd/lnd.conf on Mac OS and $home/lnd/lnd.conf on
; Plan9.
; The default location of this file can be overwritten by specifying the

;
; boolean values can be specified as true/false or 1/0. Per default

; If only one value is specified for an option, then this is also the

; is explicitly mentioned. 
; If the part after the equal sign is empty then lnd has no default

; Adding an external IP will advertise your node to the network. This signals

[gossip]

; Specify a set of pinned gossip syncers, which will always be actively syncing
; whenever the corresponding peer is online. A pinned syncer does not count
; towards the configured `numgraphsyncpeers` since pinned syncers are not
; rotated. Configuring a pinned syncer does not ensure a persistent connection
; to the target peer, they will only be pinned if the connection remains active
; via some other mechanism, e.g. having an open channel.
;
; This feature is useful when trying to ensure that a node keeps its
; routing table tightly synchronized with a set of remote peers, e.g. multiple
; lightning nodes operated by the same service.
;
; Each value should be a hex-encoded pubkey of the pinned peer. Multiple pinned
; peers can be specified by setting multiple flags/fields in the config.
; Default:
;   gossip.pinned-syncers=
; Example:
;   gossip.pinned-syncers=pubkey1
;   gossip.pinned-syncers=pubkey2

; The maximum number of updates for a specific channel and direction that lnd
; will accept over the channel update interval.
; gossip.max-channel-update-burst=10
; gossip.channel-update-interval=1m

; The duration to wait before sending the next announcement batch if there are
; multiple. Use a small value if there are a lot announcements and they need to
; be broadcast quickly.
; gossip.sub-batch-delay=5s


[invoices]

; If a hold invoice has accepted htlcs that reach their expiry height and are
; not timed out, the channel holding the htlc is force closed to resolve the
; invoice's htlcs. To prevent force closes, lnd automatically cancels these
; invoices before they reach their expiry height.
;
; Hold expiry delta describes the number of blocks before expiry that these
; invoices should be canceled. Setting this value to 0 will ensure that hold
; invoices can be settled right up until their expiry height, but will result
; in the channel they are on being force closed if they are not resolved before
; expiry.
;
; Lnd goes to chain before the expiry for a htlc is reached so that there is
; time to resolve it on chain. This value needs to be greater than the
; DefaultIncomingBroadcastDelta set by lnd, otherwise the channel will be force
; closed anyway. A warning will be logged on startup if this value is not large
; enough to prevent force closes.
; invoices.holdexpirydelta=12


[routing]

; DEPRECATED: This is now turned on by default for Neutrino (use
; neutrino.validatechannels=true to turn off) and shouldn't be used for any
; other backend!
; routing.assumechanvalid=false

; If set to true, then we'll prune a channel if only a single edge is seen as
; being stale. This results in a more compact channel graph, and also is helpful
; for neutrino nodes as it means they'll only maintain edges where both nodes are
; seen as being live from it's PoV.
; routing.strictgraphpruning=false


[sweeper]

; DEPRECATED: Duration of the sweep batch window. The sweep is held back during
; the batch window to allow more inputs to be added and thereby lower the fee
; per input.
; sweeper.batchwindowduration=30s

; The max fee rate in sat/vb which can be used when sweeping funds. Setting
; this value too low can result in transactions not being confirmed in time,
; causing HTLCs to expire hence potentially losing funds.
; sweeper.maxfeerate=1000

; The conf target to use when sweeping non-time-sensitive outputs. This is
; useful for sweeping outputs that are not time-sensitive, and can be swept at
; a lower fee rate.
; sweeper.nodeadlineconftarget=1008


; An optional config group that's used for the automatic sweep fee estimation.
; The Budget config gives options to limits ones fee exposure when sweeping
; unilateral close outputs and the fee rate calculated from budgets is capped
; at sweeper.maxfeerate. Check the budget config options for more details.
; sweeper.budget=

[sweeper.budget]

; The amount in satoshis to allocate as the budget to pay fees when sweeping
; the to_local output. If set, the budget calculated using the ratio (if set)

; The ratio of the value in to_local output to allocate as the budget to pay
; fees when sweeping it.
; sweeper.budget.tolocalratio=0.5

; The amount in satoshis to allocate as the budget to pay fees when CPFPing a
; force close tx using the anchor output. If set, the budget calculated using
; the ratio (if set) will be capped at this value.
; sweeper.budget.anchorcpfp=

; The ratio of a special value to allocate as the budget to pay fees when 
; CPFPing a force close tx using the anchor output. The special value is the
; sum of all time-sensitive HTLCs on this commitment subtracted by their
; budgets.
; sweeper.budget.anchorcpfpratio=0.5

; The amount in satoshis to allocate as the budget to pay fees when sweeping a
; time-sensitive (first-level) HTLC. If set, the budget calculated using the

; sweeper.budget.deadlinehtlc=

; The ratio of the value in a time-sensitive (first-level) HTLC to allocate as

; sweeper.budget.deadlinehtlcratio=0.5

; The amount in satoshis to allocate as the budget to pay fees when sweeping a
; non-time-sensitive (second-level) HTLC. If set, the budget calculated using
; the ratio (if set) will be capped at this value.
; sweeper.budget.nodeadlinehtlc=

; The ratio of the value in a non-time-sensitive (second-level) HTLC to
; allocate as the budget to pay fees when sweeping it.
; sweeper.budget.nodeadlinehtlcratio=0.5

[htlcswitch]

; The timeout value when delivering HTLCs to a channel link. Setting this value
; too small will result in local payment failures if large number of payments
; are sent over a short period.
; htlcswitch.mailboxdeliverytimeout=1m


[grpc]

; How long the server waits on a gRPC stream with no activity before pinging the

; ping response. Valid time units are {s, m, h}.

; ping. Valid time units are {s, m, h}.
; grpc.client-ping-min-wait=5s
