The zpay32 package implements a basic scheme for the encoding of payment
requests between two `lnd` nodes within the Lightning Network. The zpay32
encoding scheme uses the
[zbase32](https://philzimmermann.com/docs/human-oriented-base-32-encoding.txt)
scheme along with a checksum to encode a serialized payment request.

The payment request serialized by the package consist of: the destination's
public key, the payment hash to use for the payment, and the value of payment
to send.
